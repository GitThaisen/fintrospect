# overview

Fintrospect is a library that adds an intelligent HTTP routing layer to the 
<a href="http://twitter.github.io/finagle/" target="_top">Finagle</a> RPC framework from Twitter. It provides a simple way to 
implement contracts for both server and client-side HTTP services which are:

- ```Type-safe``` : auto-marshalls all request parameters/bodies into the correct types (including primitives + JSON/XML etc...)
- ```Auto-validating``` : the presence of required and optional request parameters and bodies are checked before entering service-layer code
- ```Auto-documenting``` : runtime generation of endpoint documentation such as <a href="http://swagger.io/" target="_top">Swagger</a> JSON or web sitemap XML. 
Generates <a href="http://json-schema.org/" target="_top">JSON Schema</a> for example object formats to be included in these API docs.
- ```Uniform``` : reuse the same contract to define both incoming or outgoing Finagle HTTP services. This also allows extremely low effort fake servers to be created

Additionally, Fintrospect provides a number of mechanisms to leverage these routes:

- Easily build type-safe HTTP responses with a set of custom builders for a wide variety of message formats:
  - JSON: <a href="http://argo.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">Argo</a>, <a href="http://argonaut.io/" target="_top">Argonaut</a>, <a href="https://github.com/travisbrown/circe" target="_top">Circe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/gson" 
  target="_top">GSON</a>, <a href="http://json4s.org/" target="_top">Json4S</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/gson" target="_top">Play JSON</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/gson" target="_top">Spray JSON</a>
  - Native implementations of XML, Plain Text, HTML, XHTML
- Serve static files from the classpath
- Template ```View``` support for building responses with <a href="http://mustache.github.io/" target="_top">Mustache</a> or <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com" target="_top">Handlebars</a>
- Anonymising headers for dynamic-path based endpoints, removing all dynamic path elements. This allows, for example, calls to particular endpoints to be grouped for metric purposes. e.g. 
```/search/author/rowling``` becomes ```/search/author/{name}```
- Interacts seamlessly with other Finagle based libraries, such as <a href="https://github.com/finagle/finagle-oauth2" target="_top">Finagle OAuth2</a> 
- Utilities to help you unit-test endpoint services and write HTTP contract tests for remote dependencies 

### broad concepts
The main concepts in play:

- ```RouteSpec```: defines the self-describing contract of an HTTP endpoint
- ```ServerRoute```: the binding of a ```RouteSpec``` to a Finagle ```Service```  implementing some business-logic, to create an inbound HTTP endpoint
- ```RouteClient```: the binding of a ```RouteSpec``` to a Finagle ```Service``` representing an HTTP client, to create a simple function for making outbound HTTP calls
- ```ParameterSpec```: defines the acceptable format for a request parameter (Path/Query/Header/Form-field). Provides the auto-marshalling mechanic for serializing and deserializing objects to and from HTTP messages
- ```BodySpec```: similar to ```ParameterSpec```, but applied to the body of an HTTP message
- ```ModuleSpec```: defines a set of ```ServerRoute``` instances which are grouped under a particular request path. These modules can be combined and then converted to a Finagle ```Service``` and attached to a Finagle HTTP server. Each module 
provides an endpoint under which it's own runtime-generated documentation can be served (eg. in <a href="http://swagger.io/" target="_top">Swagger</a> format)
- ```ResponseSpec```: defines the characteristics of a possible response generated by a ```ServerRoute``` 

### regarding finagle
Since Fintrospect is build on top of Finagle, it's worth acquainting yourself with it's concepts, which can be found <a href="http://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide" target="_top">here</a>. 

#### &tldr; finagle primer

1. Finagle provides protocol-agnostic RPC and is based on Netty
2. It is mainly asynchronous and makes heavy usage of Twitter's version of Scala Futures
3. It defines uniform ```Service``` and ```Filter``` interfaces for both client and server APIs that are effectively a single method...
```scala
Service:  def apply(request : Request) : Future[Response]
Filter:   def apply(request : RequestIn, service : Service[RequestOut, ResponseIn]) : Future[ResponseOut]
```
4. ```Filters``` can be chained together and then applied to a ```Service```, which results in another ```Service```. This is useful to 
apply layers of functionality such as caching headers, retry behaviour, and timeouts.

### a note on style
- The code in this guide has omitted imports that would have made the it read more concisely. The sacrifices we make in the name of learning... :)
